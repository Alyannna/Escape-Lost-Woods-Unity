# Escape-Lost-Woods-Unity
All scripts used in my game prototype "Escape the Lost Woods". As I had no prior experience in C#, I used online tutorials as a baseline, and edited each script to meet the needs of the project.

There was a last minute interaction I tried to make, being sound effects with the script "PlaySound". It's still in the project to represent the work put in. However, there wasn't adequate time to make it work properly.
