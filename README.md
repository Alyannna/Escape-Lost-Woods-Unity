# Escape-Lost-Woods-Unity
This contains all scripts used in my game prototype "Escape the Lost Woods". As I had no prior experience in C#, I used online tutorials as a baseline, and edited each script to meet the needs of the project.


FAILED ATTEMPTS
There was a last minute interaction I tried to make, being sound effects with the script "PlaySound". It's still in the project to represent the work put in. However, there wasn't adequate time to make it work properly. 

"WhateverTextThingy" was my first attempt at making an interaction that triggered pop-up text when players walked through. This was mostly made myself, however ended up not working. Its replacement is the "TurnBack" script, taken and edited from a YouTube tutorial.
